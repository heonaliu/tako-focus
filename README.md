## 🎯 Purpose & Vision

As a high school junior navigating classes, tests, projects, and life in general, I realized that staying focused and balanced is harder than it should be. TakoFocus began as a hackathon project and became a passion project focused on:

- Reducing procrastination
- Making studying **fun and calming**
- Combining my love for **coding** and **digital art**
- Exploring how **AI and digital art** can work together
